# Stack Using Array Tutorial
Create a stack using an array.

# About

This is a simple example of how to make your own stack data structure using a dynamic array and an `int` to keep track of how many elements are currently on the stack, effectively acting as a pointer to the top of the stack.

`Push` and `Pop` functions are also implemented.

# Setup

In order to setup, run the following in a shell, then open the project in your preferred editor. Windows setup has been configured for use with Visual Studio.

Windows:
```
cd path/to/folder
setup.cmd
```
Linux:
```
cd path/to/folder
./setup
```
